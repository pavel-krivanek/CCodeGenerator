inlining
statementsListsForInliningIn: aCodeGen
	"Answer a collection of statement list nodes that are candidates for inlining.
	 Currently, we cannot inline into the argument blocks of and: and or: messages.
	 We do not want to inline code strings within cCode:inSmalltalk: blocks (those with a
	 proper block for the cCode: argument are inlined in MessageNode>>asTranslatorNodeIn:).
	 We do not want to inline code within assert: sends (because we want the assert to read nicely)."
