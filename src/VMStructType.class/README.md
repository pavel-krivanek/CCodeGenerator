I am an absract superclass for classes which map to simple structs in C,  Right now I merely serve to organize all the struct types.  I would like to arrange that generated assignment accessors answer their argument to correspond with field assignment in C, but createInstVarAccessors is implemented by the browser not by ClassDescription.
